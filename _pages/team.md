## Description of Tohoku SLA team
We have a strong research team focusing on second language acquisition and bilingualism. Using a range of data collection and analysis tools such as eye-tracking and brain imaging (fMRI), we have conducted a number of joint research projects among faculty members, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students in the Graduate School of International Cultural Studies at Tohoku University. We regularly hold events inviting internationally well-known scholars in SLA, bilingualism, and linguistics, providing us with opportunities to learn about the state-of-the-art research in the relevant area (visit our website: Research Center for Language, Brain, and Cognition, for the past and upcoming events) (Description adapted from the website of Takumi Uchihara).
