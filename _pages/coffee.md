## Coffee Log
Most of my free time (other than work) involves brewing and enjoying coffee. I keep a record of coffee I've had to this date (since January 30, 2025). Not all of them but ones I thought would be noteworthy (for my reminiscence).

## Where to Start
For some interested in starting coffee life, I recommend starting with so-called <b>single origin coffee</b>, which refers to <u>coffee that comes from one specific geographic location including (in my opinion) a country, a region, or even a single farm or estate</u>. Single origin coffee is characterized with the following two characteristics:

-  Traceability: You know exactly where your coffee comes from (e.g., Longboard Misty Mountain Farm in Boquete, Panama).
-  Distinct flavor profiles: The taste reflects the <i>terroir</i>, climate, and altitude all influence the cup.

You can begin with some specific coutries (though their flavor profiles can greatly differ due various factors such as roasting). I cite James Hoffman's <i>The World Atlas of Coffee: From Beans to Brewing - Coffees Explored, Explained and Enjoyed</i>:

- Ethiopia ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¹ incredibly elegant, complex and delicious (wildly fruity and enchantingly unusual).
- Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· low in acidity, heavy in body and sweet, often with chocolate and nutty flavours.
- Colombia ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´ a huge range of flavours, from the heavier, chocolatier coffees through to jammy, sweet, fruity lots.
- Panama ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¦ citrusy and floral, light bodied, delicate and complex. (especially Geisha)
